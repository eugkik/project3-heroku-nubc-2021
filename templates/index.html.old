                        <p class="lead">Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and is a leading cause of cancer death for women. The purpose of this project was to analyze how accurate the various clinical characteristics predict survival and survival duration. The dataset used was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric">Kaggle</a> and contains clinical data and gene expression profiles. </p>

                        <p class="lead">The analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting patient survival and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection. To do this, the necessary libraries are imported as well as the dataset. Redundant columns and non-important features are dropped from the dataset and label encoder is used to label the categorical data into numbers. Pandas' visualization and r-programming is used to find the data distribution of the features. </p>

                        <p class="lead">We use classification algorithms of supervised learning with our our outcome variable having two sets of values, either live or die. 19 clinical attributes are used with the different type of models in Machine Learning including: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier. For each classification model, we will predict the test set results and check the accuracy using the confusion matrix. In addition to testing surival of patients, the linear regression model was used to determine if there is a correlation to the overall survival time in months.  </p>

                        <p class="lead">After applying the different classification models, the Random Forest Classifier produced the strongest accuracy at 0.696. Additionally, we found a weak relationship between the 19 clinical attributes and the length of survival time in months. </p>
